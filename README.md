# 12IDS-IA2-Place-Finder-Application

This is a flask-based Python web server that provides information from some Brisbane City Council sources. 

Data is hardcoded into the database and has not been updated from the time of release. This is strictly a project for educational purposes and should not be used to provide actual information.

The purpose of this application was for a grade 12 digital solutions assessment piece. You may utilise sections of this code in your own solution if I am referenced.
